# adabra-agent-engine-test

Throwaway Milestone 2 test of the Adabra agent engine: one checkpoint from a laptop is stored durably by the
coordinator (Mac mini) and shown once on a GitHub test issue.

```
helper/cli.js checkpoint -> local SQLite outbox -> HTTPS over the tailnet -> coordinator stores it, acks
                                                                          -> worker updates ONE comment on the task's issue
```

No npm dependencies. Needs Node >= 22.13 (uses `node:sqlite`).

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

Covers: normal path; duplicate event; same id with different payload (409); unknown/revoked device, wrong token;
device impersonation, bad schema, unknown task; coordinator unreachable then delivered; GitHub down then applied once;
older event never regresses a newer one.

## Run on the Mac mini (coordinator)

```bash
# 1. once: register a device and a task (the token is printed once)
node coordinator/main.js device-add member-a
node coordinator/main.js task-add TASK-1 1            # TASK-1 -> issue #1

# 2. save a fine-grained GitHub token (this repo only, Issues: read/write) to a file only you can read
umask 077; mkdir -p ~/.adabra && pbpaste > ~/.adabra/github-token   # copy the token in your browser first

# 3. start (dry-run first: logs comments instead of posting)
GITHUB_DRY_RUN=1 node coordinator/main.js serve
GITHUB_REPO=Mominumer/adabra-agent-engine-test GITHUB_TOKEN_FILE=$HOME/.adabra/github-token node coordinator/main.js serve

# 4. expose it on the tailnet only (HTTPS 443 -> localhost:8787)
tailscale serve --bg 8787
```

The coordinator listens on 127.0.0.1 only; `tailscale serve` is the only way in.

## Run the coordinator as a service (Mac mini)

```bash
service/coordinator-service.sh install     # LaunchAgent: starts at login, restarts after a crash
service/coordinator-service.sh status
service/coordinator-service.sh logs        # ~/Library/Logs/adabra-coordinator.log
service/coordinator-service.sh uninstall
```

Stop any coordinator running in a Terminal window first (port 8787). The mini must log in automatically after a reboot
(System Settings > Users & Groups > Automatic login), because a LaunchAgent runs in the user's session.

## Run on a laptop (helper)

```bash
node helper/cli.js enroll https://jbrs-mac-mini.tail1aa763.ts.net member-a
umask 077; pbpaste > ~/.team-agent/token              # the token printed by device-add
node helper/cli.js checkpoint --task TASK-1 --summary "Payment screen implemented" \
  --verification "8 passed, 1 failed" --next "Fix failed payment handling"
node helper/cli.js status                              # outbox counts
```

## Not built yet (by design)

Claim/lease validation (`claim_generation` is carried but not checked), cancellation, review workers, context
delivery, Slack. See the blueprint milestones M3-M7.
