# adabra-agent-engine-test

Throwaway Milestone 2 test of the Adabra agent engine: one checkpoint from a laptop is stored durably by the
coordinator (Mac mini) and shown once on a GitHub test issue.

```
helper/cli.js checkpoint -> local SQLite outbox -> HTTPS over the tailnet -> coordinator stores it, acks
                                                                          -> worker updates ONE comment on the task's issue
```

No npm dependencies. Needs Node >= 22.13 (uses `node:sqlite`).

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

Covers: normal path; duplicate event; same id with different payload (409); unknown/revoked device, wrong token;
device impersonation, bad schema, unknown task; coordinator unreachable then delivered; GitHub down then applied once;
older event never regresses a newer one.

## Run on the Mac mini (coordinator)

```bash
# 1. once: register a device and a task (the token is printed once)
node coordinator/main.js device-add member-a
node coordinator/main.js task-add TASK-1 1            # TASK-1 -> issue #1

# 2. save a fine-grained GitHub token (this repo only, Issues: read/write) to a file only you can read
umask 077; mkdir -p ~/.adabra && pbpaste > ~/.adabra/github-token   # copy the token in your browser first

# 3. start (dry-run first: logs comments instead of posting)
GITHUB_DRY_RUN=1 node coordinator/main.js serve
GITHUB_REPO=Mominumer/adabra-agent-engine-test GITHUB_TOKEN_FILE=$HOME/.adabra/github-token node coordinator/main.js serve

# 4. expose it on the tailnet only (HTTPS 443 -> localhost:8787)
tailscale serve --bg 8787
```

The coordinator listens on 127.0.0.1 only; `tailscale serve` is the only way in.

## Run the coordinator as a service (Mac mini)

```bash
service/coordinator-service.sh install     # LaunchAgent: starts at login, restarts after a crash
service/coordinator-service.sh status
service/coordinator-service.sh logs        # ~/Library/Logs/adabra-coordinator.log
service/coordinator-service.sh uninstall
```

Stop any coordinator running in a Terminal window first (port 8787). The mini must log in automatically after a reboot
(System Settings > Users & Groups > Automatic login), because a LaunchAgent runs in the user's session.

## Run on a laptop (helper)

```bash
node helper/cli.js enroll https://jbrs-mac-mini.tail1aa763.ts.net member-a
umask 077; pbpaste > ~/.team-agent/token              # the token printed by device-add
node helper/cli.js checkpoint --task TASK-1 --summary "Payment screen implemented" \
  --verification "8 passed, 1 failed" --next "Fix failed payment handling"
node helper/cli.js status                              # outbox counts
```

## Run the helper in the background (laptops, and the mini as a builder)

```bash
service/helper-service.sh install     # LaunchAgent: renews held leases and delivers queued checkpoints every 30 s
service/helper-service.sh status
node helper/cli.js status             # outbox, claims held, and whether the agent is reporting
service/helper-service.sh uninstall
```

After `claim`, nobody needs to run `heartbeat` or `flush`. If a claim is lost the agent drops it and shows a desktop notification.

## Run the helper on Windows

Run these in PowerShell from the repo folder. You need Node 22.13 or newer on PATH. You do not need admin rights, and no
password is stored. **Not yet run on a real Windows machine**: if something misbehaves, the log and `status` are the place to start.

```powershell
node helper\cli.js enroll https://<coordinator-host> <device-id>
Get-Clipboard | Set-Content -NoNewline -Encoding ascii -LiteralPath "$HOME\.team-agent\token"   # copy the token first

powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File service\helper-service.ps1 install
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File service\helper-service.ps1 status
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File service\helper-service.ps1 logs        # %LOCALAPPDATA%\Adabra\Logs\adabra-helper.log
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File service\helper-service.ps1 uninstall
node helper\cli.js status                                                                   # outbox, claims held, and whether the agent is reporting
```

`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` applies to that one command and changes no setting. `install` is safe to repeat; run it again after
moving the repo folder or Node. `uninstall` leaves your enrollment and the log in place.

- **Starts at logon, in your session.** The task `ai.adabra.helper` runs only while you are logged on, on battery too, with no
  time limit and no window. A lost claim shows a Windows notification, and is always in the log.
- **Comes back after a crash.** A supervisor restarts the agent after 10 seconds. If the supervisor itself dies, a trigger that
  fires every minute starts the task again; while the task is running that trigger does nothing.
- **What protects the token.** `chmod` and `umask` do nothing on Windows; the folder's access list does the job. Your profile
  folder already allows only you, SYSTEM and Administrators, and `install` sets the same on `TEAM_AGENT_HOME`, wherever it is.
  `status` warns if anyone else can open the folder or the token. As with root on macOS, an administrator can always read it.

## Assigning work

Tasks come from GitHub issues. Label an issue `agent-task` and the coordinator creates `TASK-<issue number>` within a minute
(it also runs `node coordinator/main.js task-sync` on demand). Add a label `assign:<device-id>` to reserve it for that
enrolled device; without one, anyone can claim it. Closing the issue or removing the label closes the task. Tasks added by
hand with `task-add` are never changed by the sync; use `task-assign <TASK-1> <device-id|none>` for those.

```bash
node coordinator/main.js tasks               # mini: every task, who it is reserved for, who holds it
node helper/cli.js tasks                      # laptop: what you can work on (reserved for you first)
node helper/cli.js claim-next                 # claim the first available one
```

A reserved task refuses everyone else's claim (`reserved for member-b`); a closed task refuses all claims.

## Review worker (Mac mini: dispatcher + Docker test sandbox)

Watches open PRs and puts two commit statuses on every new head commit: `adabra/tests` and `adabra/review`. Make both
required in branch protection and a failing or missing check blocks the merge; a new push is checked again.
`adabra/tests` runs `npm test` on the exact commit inside a throwaway Docker container (no network, no host files, no
secrets, not root, read-only system, 4 GB / 2 CPU / 512 processes / 15 min). `adabra/review` is the mock review skill
(`reviewer/review-mock.js`, reviewer `mock-v1`): it reads the PR's diff for that exact commit and fails on an added
`debugger;` line or `MOCK-REVIEW: fail` in the PR description. The real Claude review will replace only this step. See `REVIEW_WORKER_PLAN.md` in the plan folder.

```bash
umask 077; mkdir -p ~/.adabra; read -rs T; printf %s "$T" > ~/.adabra/review-token; unset T   # paste token, Enter
docker pull node:26-slim
node reviewer/main.js sandbox-check        # must print "sandbox is locked down" before any PR runs
REVIEW_AUTHORS=Mominumer REVIEW_IMAGE=$(docker image inspect node:26-slim --format '{{index .RepoDigests 0}}') \
  service/reviewer-service.sh install
service/reviewer-service.sh status
node reviewer/main.js retry <pr>          # run a PR's latest commit again
```

Only PRs from branches of this repo, by authors in `REVIEW_AUTHORS`, and not drafts, are run.

## Review results on tasks

When the reviewer finishes a PR that belongs to a task, the coordinator learns the result: the task's progress comment
shows `review passed`, `changes requested` with a summary of the findings, or `review could not complete`, and
`node helper/cli.js tasks` shows it too. A PR belongs to a task if its branch is exactly `task/TASK-7` or its description has a
line reading exactly `Task: TASK-7`. A PR that names two different tasks is linked to neither.

Text from a review is untrusted, because it can quote the code under review. The progress comment shows it only inside a
labelled code block, where Markdown, images, links and mentions do nothing. `tasks` is read by builder agents, so it never
carries that text at all: only the verdict, severity (one of a closed list), location (a path with no spaces, and a line) and
counts, with a note saying where the details are and what they are.

```
reviewer: statuses and PR comment posted -> result saved in reviewer.db with the job -> POST /v1/review-results (own timer, retried)
coordinator: stored durably, acks -> worker updates the task's ONE progress comment (retried)
```

The reviewer posts as its own enrolled device. Devices have a role, fixed when they are added: only a `reviewer` may post
results, and only a `builder` may claim tasks, write checkpoints or list tasks. The coordinator alone holds the GitHub token
that writes to the task's issue.

```bash
node coordinator/main.js device-add mini-reviewer reviewer     # prints the token once
umask 077; read -rs T; printf %s "$T" > ~/.adabra/reviewer-device-token; unset T   # paste token, Enter
REVIEW_DEVICE_ID=mini-reviewer REVIEW_COORDINATOR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 REVIEW_AUTHORS=... REVIEW_IMAGE=... \
  service/reviewer-service.sh install
node reviewer/main.js status                                   # also lists results that are not delivered
```

Without `REVIEW_DEVICE_ID` the feature is off (the log says so) and reviews run exactly as before. Results wait in
`reviewer.db` for as long as the coordinator is away, or its token or role is wrong; they are dropped only when the
coordinator refuses them for good, such as for an unknown task. A result for an older commit never replaces one for a newer
commit, and a re-delivered result changes nothing.

A failed review **returns** the task to its owner. That is a reservation, not a claim: no lease or claim generation changes.
Others are refused (`a failed review returned it to member-a`), and the owner sees it first in `tasks` and claims it as usual,
which ends the reservation. The owner is the device the task is reserved for, else whoever holds the live lease, else whoever
claimed it last, even if they have released. A passing review also ends it. If the owner has gone away, revoking the device
ends it, as does `node coordinator/main.js task-assign TASK-7 <device-id|none>`.

## Not built yet (by design)

Claim/lease validation (`claim_generation` is carried but not checked), cancellation, review workers, context
delivery, Slack. See the blueprint milestones M3-M7.
